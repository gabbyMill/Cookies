- [ ] On registration update user info in db using bcrypt
- [ ] update api/shorturl to put new url objects in db, old db is array of objects
- [ ]

#### update api/statistic to respond with statistics base on id(req.params)

#### update route to respons with statistics and not whole object, if you do this be sure to update front to handle it accordingly

- [x] get: /:id pulls url out of db
